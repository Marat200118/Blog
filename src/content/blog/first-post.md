Starting a new project can feel overwhelming, but it’s also exciting—especially when it’s an idea you’re passionate about. Here’s how I’ve started turning my vision into something real.

I knew I wanted to build an app that works on both iOS and Android, so I started exploring cross-platform frameworks. Ionic seemed like the perfect fit. It’s developer-friendly, has a ton of useful features, and lets you use familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build mobile apps.

The first thing I did was follow Ionic’s basic tutorial. I know, not very exciting, but it helped me understand the fundamentals: how to set up a project, use Ionic components, and create navigation. From there, I experimented with some of the tools Ionic offers, like its prebuilt UI libraries, which are super customizable.

One of the coolest (and trickiest) parts was getting Ionic to work with Xcode. Since I’m developing for iOS, I needed to connect everything so I could test the app on an iPhone simulator. It took a bit of Googling, a lot of trial and error, and a few moments of frustration, but I finally got it working. Seeing the app open in the simulator for the first time? That was a win.
